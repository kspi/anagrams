# anagrams.py

This is a simple program that tries to generate all anagrams for a
phrase, output one per line.

Usage:

    python anagrams.py cup of tea

The program tries to use the system dictionary file at
`/usr/share/dict/words` but if you want to use another file, copy it to
`dict` or `dict.txt` in the current directory. It should contain one
word per line.
